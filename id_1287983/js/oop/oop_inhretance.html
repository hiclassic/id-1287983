    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>
        The code defines a base class <code>Vehicle</code> and a derived class <code>Car</code>. The <code>Vehicle</code> class has properties like <code>brand</code>, <code>model</code>, and <code>year</code>, and methods to start and stop the engine, as well as to get the vehicle's details.
    </p> 
    <p>
        The <code>Car</code> class extends the <code>Vehicle</code> class, inheriting its properties and methods. It adds additional properties like <code>fuelType</code> and <code>transmission</code>, and overrides the <code>getDetails</code> method to include these new properties. The <code>Car</code> class also has methods to accelerate and brake, which are specific to cars.
    </p>
    <p>
        An instance of the <code>Car</code> class is created, and its methods are called to demonstrate the functionality of inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism in object-oriented programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        Inheritance allows the <code>Car</code> class to reuse code from the <code>Vehicle</code> class, encapsulation hides the internal state of the objects, and polymorphism allows the <code>Car</code> class to provide its own implementation of the <code>getDetails</code> method.
    </p>
    <p>
        This example illustrates the core principles of object-oriented programming, showcasing how classes can be structured to promote code reuse and maintainability.
